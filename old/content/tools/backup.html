Backup
</div>
<div class="article">
<p>
Taking a backup of the data, has been the most challenging task for me. I always neglected a data backup. Recently, a friend of mine just dropped her laptop. Thankfully she only had documents there, which she had stored online as well. Her laptop also survived the fall, so it was no loss. But if something similar would have happened to me, I can guarantee you that I have absolutely no backup, and all my work will be lost.Thats sad but true. And even as a person who is always thinking about new ways to do things on computer, I never gave this a thought.

After this incident with my friend, I am now taking backup of all my data. Planning to keep all my projects open-source on <a href="http://github.com/varun729">GitHub</a> and also taking a backup on an external hard disk. Initially I copied all the files onto the disk using the <pre>cp</pre> command. But I found it to be too much redundant. Now I am using the command:
<pre>rsync -av --delete-excluded [src/directory] [dest/directory]</pre>
This not only copies all the files from source to destination, but also sees if the files have changed or not, and copies only the modified files. Also the <tt>--delete-excluded</tt> option, allows me to keep the backup up-to-date. As in if I have deleted a folder in the source, on taking the backup, the same folder will be deleted from the destination as well. This is very useful to remove the redundant portions.
