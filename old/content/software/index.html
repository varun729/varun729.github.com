While working at Bangalore, the best experience has been the excellent weather, which makes any physical workout to be very comfortable, and unlike extreme weather doesn't wear you out before the body does. I started cycling more as recreational stuff than workout, and was trying to log my distances. Having a Android phone, I developed an app for remembering all the tracks I had covered while cyling.

Collecting feedback for Android apps through Android Market is the de-facto approach taken by most of the apps. It is convenient for Google to provide a market, which also acts as a single source point where users can look at the reviews of the app. It is indeed very helpful for a user to look at the reviews before downloading an application. But there are some big questions which Google has not yet answered.</p>
