Cycling
</div>
<div class="article">
<p>
Bangalore is a great city for outdoor activities. It gives lovely weather throughout the year, and thus is also the favourite destination for the young crowd. I explored cycling as my recreational activity and have enjoyed it. I have been active in sports in the past, and thus cycling 5-10 kilometers was normal for me. But, after meeting some really nice bikers, I can now ride for even a century. Apart from the centuries a few times, I have also climbed a 30km uphill, and rode within tea gardens. It has been my best experience so far, cycling in Kerala.

Photography
</div>
<div class="article">
<p>
I have a fear of photography, which I try to overcome by taking more pics. I sometimes think of a camera as a tool to invade someone's privacy. I often find it odd clicking photographs of people, even though I find them interesting. In order to overcome this fear I click photos.
</p>
<p>
Well the true reason to click photos, is to get appreciation from others. I click photos and then try to fix them a bit, and present them to friends to see their reaction. Photos which please others, give satisfaction of doing something other than the usual stuff. I use a Canon 1000D, with 18-55mm lens or the 50mm prime lens.
