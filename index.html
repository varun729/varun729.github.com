        <h3>Bio</h3>

<p>
I am a first year PhD student in the department of Computer Science, at Stony 
Brook University. I completed my B.Tech. from Indian Institute of Technology 
Kanpur in 2010, with major in Electrical Engineering. After graduating I worked
as a software developer for 2 years in Strand Life Sciences.
</p>

<p>I am interested in Computer Systems and almost anything dealing with it. I 
love to program and for around 2 years, my hobby was to try out different 
programming languages.</p>
