I am currently developing <strong>SemanticHomepage</strong>. This project will allow me to 
update my homepage through a Java UI. I am using Semantic Web for structuring the homepage. 
Once the project is ready, I hope to load the data using the UI, into N-triples format, 
and then parse them to create the HTML. This will help me putting all my efforts in 
designing the page, since the content part will be taken care of by the system.

Current version of the ontology can be downloaded at <a href="homepage.owl">homepage.owl</a>. 
You can contact me through <a href="mailto:varun729@gmail.com">email</a>. Let me know how
you think of the project.

You will know when the project is ready, if you see actual homepage here instead of this 
message :-)
