    <h2> Varun Agrawal </h2>
    <p> I am a first year PhD student in the Computer Science department at
    Stony Brook University. I am advised by <a
    href="http://compas.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mferdman">Prof. Mike Ferdman</a>. I
    am interested in anything which makes a computer work. And since there are
    only 24 hours in a day, I am looking into a much smaller subset.
    </p>
    
    <p> I am working on JITing a kernel
    </p>
    
    <p> I have done some work on optimizing software using JIT compilation,
    based on some heuristics. <!-- We are assuming that there will be variables
    which will not be modified very often in the lifecycle of the program. -->
