MyCycle

<p>
While working at Bangalore, the best experience has been the excellent weather, which makes any physical workout to be very comfortable, and unlike extreme weather doesn't wear you out before the body does. I started cycling more as recreational stuff than workout, and was trying to log my distances. Having a Android phone, I developed an app for remembering all the tracks I had covered while cyling.
</p>
<p>
There is a very active community on the web for people enthusiastic about physical workouts, <a href="http://www.dailymile.com">Dailymile</a>. I promoted my application on the website, by linking the application with the website. People using the MyCycle app, could upload their tracks directly to the website and also update their profile on the website. I found it very useful, for the short while I used the website. I found people who were interested in using the application and gave some useful suggestions for the application.
</p>
<p>
The application can be downloaded through <a href="http://market.android.com">Android Market</a>.
