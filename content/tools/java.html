I started programming the first time in high school with C++, using the Turbo C++ compiler. The compiler though, the most naive, does give a good beginning. During my B.Tech., first year course in programming introduced Java as the programming language. We were only introduced to the programming language and its technical nuances. I was not very attracted to the language and looked at C++ as more interesting. By the end of my B.Tech., I had programmed in Python, Haskell, Fortran, MATLAB and C. It was more of an experimental programming experience when I tried to understand the pros and cons of different languages.

While working at Strand, I got to work with Java and Python. This time I was more interested in learning the design aspect of software development. I learnt a few design patterns which helped me in programming more efficiently. I found Java to be a very well structured language, in which programming has become much easier.
