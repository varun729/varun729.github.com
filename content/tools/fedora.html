Linux(Fedora)
</div>
<div class="article">
<p>
I have been using linux for the last one year. Having a Ubuntu desktop at office, I also used Ubuntu at home. It was very user-friendly and I got started with it pretty smoothly. With the new heavy-weight Unity desktop environment, I got pissed off and decided to try a new distribution. I have used Fedora in the past while at college, but that time I was less familiar with the terminal and the commands. I used to work more with mouse than with keyboard.
</p>
<p>
Now that I enjoy using terminal I try to do most of my work through it. Trying to use minimum commands. I have learnt some basic <em>Shell scripting</em>, and it has been fun so far trying to customize my laptop for my needs.
</p>
<p>I am using <em>Fedora 16</em>, and loving every bit of it. In the beginning I had few issues with getting the wifi driver to work, but after spending some 2 hours, I was able to fix it. Trying to fix this, I got excited to know more about the internals of Linux, and have decided to spend sometime on it. Currently I have started reading the book - <em>The C Programming Language (K & R)</em>, to learn the nuances of C language, specially pointers. I also intend to study about the <em>kernel</em>.
