Linux(Fedora)
</div>
<div class="article">
<p>
I have been using linux for the last one year. Having a Ubuntu desktop at office, I also used Ubuntu at home. It was very user-friendly and I got started with it pretty smoothly. With the new heavy-weight Unity desktop environment, I got pissed off and decided to try a new distribution. I have used Fedora in the past while at college, but that time I was less familiar with the terminal and the commands. I used to work more with mouse than with keyboard.

Vim

<p>
Vim has been my de facto text editor since I started using linux. Reading about all the hype around Vim and Emacs, I was initially confused between what to choose. I thought of trying both the editors and then deciding which one to use. But it so happened that I started using Vim, learnt its commands, and forgot about Emacs. That has been my story.

Backup
</div>
<div class="article">
<p>
After this incident with my friend, I am now taking backup of all my data. Planning to keep all my projects open-source on <a href="http://github.com/varun729">GitHub</a> and also taking a backup on an external hard disk. Initially I copied all the files onto the disk using the <pre>cp</pre> command. But I found it to be too much redundant. Now I am using the command:
<pre>rsync -av --delete-excluded [src/directory] [dest/directory]</pre>
This not only copies all the files from source to destination, but also sees if the files have changed or not, and copies only the modified files. Also the <tt>--delete-excluded</tt> option, allows me to keep the backup up-to-date. As in if I have deleted a folder in the source, on taking the backup, the same folder will be deleted from the destination as well. This is very useful to remove the redundant portions.

Eclipse

<div class="article">
<p>
Its a great Interactive Development Environment(IDE). The best part about <tt>eclipse</tt> is its framework which is all of it actually. The several plugins written for the framework is what is what we see, be it environments for Java or Python or for web development.

Java
</div>
<div class="article">
<p>
I started programming the first time in high school with C++, using the Turbo C++ compiler. The compiler though, the most naive, does give a good beginning. During my B.Tech., first year course in programming introduced Java as the programming language. We were only introduced to the programming language and its technical nuances. I was not very attracted to the language and looked at C++ as more interesting. By the end of my B.Tech., I had programmed in Python, Haskell, Fortran, MATLAB and C. It was more of an experimental programming experience when I tried to understand the pros and cons of different languages.
