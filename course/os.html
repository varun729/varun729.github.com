<h3>JOS Lab</h3>
<p>
The most significant part of the course is the lab work. The whole duration of the course
is divided up into 7 labs. Each of which involves implementing one part of an operating 
system. We use JOS as the base.
</p>
<p>
Following are the components of the labs which have been done so far:
</p>

<h4>Setting up bootloader</h4>
<p>
We are supposed to write parts of code for the bootloader. This lab helps in understanding
<ul>
	<li>How does a system start up?</li>
	<li>What is the first instruction which is executed?</li>
	<li>Difference between the real mode and long mode.</li>
	<li>How the system start executing kernel code from the bootloader?</li>
</ul>
