<h2>Least Common Ancestor in a Tree</h2>
[Under progress]
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Trees are one of the basic data structures used regularly. It is very
straight-forward to design a tree, and use it. But the complexity arises when
analysis has to be done on the tree. Trees are helpful in modeling parent child
relationships between objects and when the distance between objects is not very
important. But since the only information with every object is about its parent
and its child, doing any analysis other than that requires traversal as one of
the steps, which itself takes O(n) time. When the analysis is to be done once,
it is not okay, but if it is to be done multiple times, it becomes costly.
</p>
<p>
One of the problems which is difficult to solve directly is finding the smallest
sub-tree containing given leaf nodes. One solution is <b>the whole tree</b>. But
it is possible to find smaller sub-trees which also contain the given leaves.
One way is to look at each intermediate node, and find all the leaf nodes in it
and then see if it contains given leaves. This can take O(n^2) time. For large
trees this is not feasible, and imagine doing this in a UI application!

This problem is called the <b>Least Common Ancestor</b> problem. And this
write-up discusses different algorithms to find it, with decreasing order of
complexity.

Sciences</b>.)

<h3>Linear Tree</h3>
<p>
As can be seen in the figure below, a linear tree can give solution in O(1)
time. The node which is upper in the tree, is the least ancestor.

Lets look at more complex trees.

<h3>Trees as arrays</h3>
<p>
Representing trees as arrays (so that problem can be linearized)
</p>

<h3>Finding LCA in linear time</h3>
<p>
Creating a data structure which takes 2*n space, O(n), by pre-computing, and
then using it to find the LCA in O(n) time
</p>

<h3>Finding LCA in constant time</h3>
<p>
Creating a data structure which takes O(n*log(n)) space, but finds the LCA
in O(1) time
</p>

<h3>Finding LCA in constant time with linear time pre-computation</h3>
<p>
Creating a data structure which takes O(n) space with the help of blocks and
then finds the LCA in O(1) time.
