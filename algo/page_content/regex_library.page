I was once suggested that to learn low level nuances of programming, it is a
good idea to start with a good project. One such project which I was suggested
was to write a regex library for C. It has been long since I have thought about
it seriously. Now that I am reading Theory of Computation, and specifically
about regular expressions and regular languages, I thought of trying to create a
library.

<b>API structure ideas:</b><br />
<ul>
        <li>regex structure object</li>
        <li>function to check if a string matches a regex expression</li>
        <li>function to check location of substring where a string matches a
        regex expression</li>
        <li>how many times a string matches the regex expression</li>
        <li>search and replace a regex expression</li>
</ul>
</p>
