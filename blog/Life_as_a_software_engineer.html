<h2>Life as a software engineer</h2>
<p>
A new subject has always attracted my attention, and I have always spent
sometime in exploring and learning atleast something about it. During high
school I was very enthusiastic about mathematics and used to spend hours solving
problems and reading about it. I was sure of how I would spend the rest of my
life (solving problems). Well, had I not got interested into the idea of
becoming an engineer, I might well be doing it. Anyways, I studied Electrical
Engineering and studied electromagnetics upto a considerable depth. I have since
then delved more in to computers, and now I am a software engineer. It is a very
concise <i>life history</i>, but important to me.
</p>
<p>
I have been working as a software engineer since August 2010, and luckily in a
company run by professors and not managers. So I still spend a lot of time
studying new things. Although there is still a lot of pressure of delivering
products, but I always am able to find a problem other than work, which is more
interesting than the work.
</p>
<p>
Most of the time I have think of ways in which a particular feature can be
embedded into the software, and it often requires using some available library.
But recently I have had the opportunity to work on more interesting stuff.
<b>Creating a suffix array for the human genome</b> sounds much more fun than
anything. I learnt a lot from it. There is a similar challenging task where I
need to create a graph (plot) for some metric for the human genome. Now these
are times when you actually feel like an engineer.

Working at Strand (<a href="http://www.strandls.com">Strand Life Sciences</a>),
has many advantages. You get to attend lectures by one of the best professors,
<a href="http://www.hariharan-ramesh.com">Ramesh Hariharan</a>. Recently he
discussed about how to find the <b>Least Common Ancestor</b> in a tree. This is
a very interesting problem and the way he simplified it, really boggles me. His
lectures are always enlightening and interesting. And you get motivated to do
something. I am currently implementing the algorithm, and will soon update it
here on the website.
