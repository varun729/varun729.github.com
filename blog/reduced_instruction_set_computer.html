Atmega8 features <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computing">RISC</a> architecture. From its name we can interpret that the number of instructions available to use it will be very limited, but will allow to create any complex algorithm using a combination.
</p>
<p>
Below is a summary from what I understood by reading : <a href="http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/WS94/RA/RISC-9.html">The RISC Concept - A Survey of Implementations</a></p>
<p>
<b>RISC(Reduced Instruction Set Computer)</b>
<ol>
<li>The instruction set must be kept simple</li>
<li>The instructions should run in a minimal time</li>
<li>Pipelining is more important than the size of the code</li>
<li>Compilers should be optimized to transfer complexity from the hardware to the compiler phase</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Simply, RISC traits are known as:
<ul>
<li>small instruction set</li>
<li>load/store architecture</li>
<li>fixed length coding and hardware decoding</li>
<li>large register set</li>
<li>delayed branching</li>
<li>processor throughput of once instruction per cycle at an average</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Calling a processor RISCy just on the basis of the instruction set size, is giving incomplete information. A processor should satisfy the 'one instruction per cycle on average' requirement.</p>
<p>
<b>Phases in a execution path of an instruction:</b>
<ul>
<li>instruction fetch</li>
<li>decode</li>
<li>operation fetch</li>
<li>ALU execution</li>
<li>memory access</li>
<li>write back the results</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
A sequential processor, can keep the execution path such that different parts of the execution path for different instructions can be executed simultaneously. This is parallelism at a single processor level. This is a core feature of RISC processors, and is achieved by designing a suitable instruction set for pipelining.</p>
<p>
The different stages of a pipeline needs to be independent of each other so that they can be executed in parallel. Also, each stage should take the same time, referred to as one clock cycle. The deeper the pipeline (more the number of stages per instruction), easier is to achieve parallelism, but it complicates the overall design.</p>
<p>
If different instructions require different size of bits to be read, the pipeline stages will become dependent upon the size of the instruction (time required to fetch). This can be overcome by having a buffer, which pre-fetches, but easier approach would be to have all instructions designed such that they are of the same size. Similar decoding scheme for the instructions also will make it more simpler to implement (MIPS is a RISC architecture which uses this). Having to read register/memory takes some extra time, which if can be avoided will help in reducing the pipeline stalling.</p>
<p>
<b>Load/Store architecture </b>is a feature of the RISC. 'load' means loading the contents from memory into a register, and 'store' is the reverse. They take one clock cycle to execute, but if in the design, they are used a couple of clock cycles later, they will be surely available to be used. In case they are still not available pipeline will stall till available. The compiler usually handles the scheduling of when the register should be used.</p>
