<h2>Blog framework</h2>
<p>
Just finished working on this new framework to create my blog. Haven't thought
of a name for this yet. This still needs lot of refinement, but is functional
now and this is the first post on the blog.
</p>

<p>
I'm now successful in creating a template for the blog which will be followed
for all the pages and I don't need to worry about keeping all the pages in sync.
