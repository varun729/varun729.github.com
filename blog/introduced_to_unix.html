<h1>Introduced to UNIX</h1>
<p>
I am currently reading about the UNIX operating system. It is interesting to know about the philosophy behind the design of an operating system which has survived more than 3 decades, both by itself and by its design. Majority of my time is spent in reading about the design. It has been long since I have updated the blog here, and I intend to begin writing again.</p>
<p>
I will be posting atleast once a week to keep a log of what I understand by the design. By no means it is intended to be a summary of what I study, there might be many portions I don't recall and may skip here. Mostly I will be trying to discuss some exercises here.</p>
