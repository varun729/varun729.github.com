<h1>Bootin OS</h1>
<p>
I have been reading about the UNIX operating systems. I have also become more excited about how a computer understands how to open a particular operating system, or why do we get a list of operating systems while we boot (in case of dual/multi boot systems).</p>
<p>In a computer, the operating system we load is on a hard disk. We might be having multiple operating systems on disk. Now, when we boot the computer, it reads the first few bites of the hard disk, to understand what to do. It gets the information about where to look for the several booting options, which are located in some bootloader, commonly GRUB in case of Linux. In the setting of our bootloader we specify the list of operating system, or a single operating system which we want to start. And the computer then decides whether to show a list, or just start a particular OS.</p>
<p>
The starting of a computer which looked so trivial at first, suddenly starts to make some sense. Now there are a few things I want to do after having to understand a bit about them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understand the working of a microcontroller.</li>
<li>Understand how to program a microcontroller, in case it can program itself. E.g. atmega8</li>
<li>Learn using Linux tools to code for a microcontroller using C and assembly (this is just for fun).</li>
<li>Design a project for the microcontroller.</li>
</ol>
